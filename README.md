# BitJumper Game Capstone Project

This repository hosts the source code for BitJumper, a fantasy action platformer game. This project is a collaborative effort between students of the Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Games and Interactivity programs at Swinburne University, as part of the SWE 40001 SEPA and SEPB units.

## Concept

BitJumper is an action platformer that evolves in graphical style as the player progresses. Starting from an 8-bit aesthetic, it transitions to a 2.5D platformer. The game takes inspiration from classic platformers such as Metroid, Mega Man, and Super Mario Bros, as well as Evoland, a game known for its evolutionary RPG mechanics. BitJumper is being developed using the Unity engine.

## Team

The BitJumper team is composed of dedicated students from the Computer Science and Games and Interactivity programs.
